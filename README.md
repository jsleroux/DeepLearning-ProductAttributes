# DeepLearning-ProductAttributes

This is a project that was part of a hackathon at JDA Labs. It was my first experience with deep learning and I learned a lot on the subject and also on machine learning:
- Keras
- Fine-tuning
- Transfer learning using VGG16
- Class Activation Maps
- Diagnostic of various models using confusion matrix
- Early stopping
- Visualization of learned features using t-SNE
- Multinomial attribute classification vs attribute level binary classification
- Weighted classes

My code is highly inspired from the deep learning book of Fran√ßois Chollet: https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python
